## DADS5001: Assignment 3 (Plotly)
Using Plotly for Data visualization.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset for this study is sourced from Kaggle, on the English Premier League (EPL) football tournament for the 2021-2022 season.<br>
The dataset is available at below link, with a wide range of metrics that capture the dynamics of each match throughout the season.<br>

## Focus Metric: Full-Time Result (FTR)
Among the various metrics provided, our analysis will concentrate on the "Full-Time Result" (FTR), which records the outcome of a match in terms of a home win (H), draw (D), or away win (A). This particular metric offers a straightforward yet insightful perspective on the performance of each team across the tournament.<br>

## Why selecting this chart
Comparative Analysis: This data involves comparing two related aspects of performance between home and away win rates for football teams, enabling viewers to quickly see how teams fare in different settings.

Identification of Patterns: By plotting each team as a distinct point, it's easier to identify patterns or trends within the league, such as whether teams generally perform better at home or away, or if there's a wide variance in performance across the league.

Use of Median Lines: Including median lines for home and away win rates helps in understanding the distribution of the data. It highlights teams that are above or below the median, allowing for a quick assessment of which teams are performing better or worse than average in both home and away games. This can also indicate a general trend of home advantage if many teams have higher win rates at home.<br>

Through this data visualization on the FTR metric, we gain a deeper understanding of team dynamics and the competitive balance within the league, contributing to broader discussions on sports analytics and performance assessment in professional football.<br>
